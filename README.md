# 💬 Public Chat App

A real-time public chat web app where users can join, send messages, and chat with others instantly. Each user is identified by a unique username and a colorful avatar. The app also supports private chat rooms for more focused conversations.

## 👨‍💻 My Role

I built the entire application from scratch – both the frontend and backend. I designed the UI, set up the real-time messaging system, and handled user management and private room features.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML, CSS, JavaScript** – For the user interface  
- **Node.js & Express** – Backend server  
- **Socket.io** – Real-time communication  
- **Git & GitHub** – Version control and code hosting

## ⚙ Features

- Real-time messaging
- Unique avatars and usernames
- Private chat rooms
- Clean and responsive UI

## 🚧 Note

> 🔒 The server is currently **privately controlled** for development and testing.  
> Once the system is stable and finalized, it will be **made publicly available** for everyone to use.


## 🏁 Getting Started (for developers)

1. Clone the repository  
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies  
3. Start the server with `node server.js`  
4. Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser
